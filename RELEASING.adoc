= Releasing Kiali UI

Since Kiali v1.35, the kiali-ui is no longer released to NPM. The UI is now
only being packaged together with the back-end in a container image that
is published in link:https://quay.io/repository/kiali/kiali?tab=tags[Kiali's Quay.io repository].

Packaging the front-end and the back-end together has been the way to release
Kiali for a long time. It's only the NPM artifact that is no longer being published.

link:https://github.com/kiali/kiali/blob/master/RELEASING.adoc[RELEASING.adoc document
in the back-end repository].
