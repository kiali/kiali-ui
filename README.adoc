= Kiali UI
image:https://coveralls.io/repos/github/kiali/kiali-ui/badge.svg?branch=master[Coverage Status, link=https://coveralls.io/github/kiali/kiali-ui?branch=master]

== Introduction

A UI for the Swift-Sunshine Istio Observability Project

== Technologies
* React.js
* TBD

== Quick Start
[source,shell]
----
npm install
npm start
----

A new browser window should automatically open.
But, if it doesn't then use:
`http://localhost:3000`

This launches a development environment that instantly
reloads any changes to the browser for rapid development.

== Developing

When developing, is usual to run this application outside of https://github.com/kiali/kiali[kiali].

Is possible to proxy the API requests without having to push the changes to kiali.
Add the https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#proxying-api-requests-in-development[proxy]
property to `package.json` with the url of kiali.
[source, json]
----
{
  "name": "kiali-ui",
  "version": "0.2.1",
  "proxy": "http://kiali-istio-system.127.0.0.1.nip.io",
  "bugs": {
...
----

Run `npm start` and try it!
[source, bash]
----
$ curl -u jdoe:password http://localhost:3000/api
Namespaces: [default istio-system kube-public kube-system myproject openshift openshift-infra openshift-node]

Namespace: default Services [docker-registry kubernetes router]

Service Name: docker-registry
Service Labels:
docker-registry = default
Type: ClusterIP
...
----

WARNING: The proxy will only serve requests without the text/html accept header,
using the browser directly won't work.

== Production Builds
Use `npm run build` which will bundle the build artifacts using webpack into the `build` directory.

== Directory Structure
* `src` : Source and test code
* `src/assets` : Images and other assets
* `src/components` : Stateless components (pure functions)
* `src/pages` : Top level pages and nested components
* `stories`: Storybook files
* `build`: Production build output
* `public`: home of index.html

== Styling
PatternFly is the main UI components framework. It defines style based on SASS preprocessor.
All Patternfly build assets are copied to `src`. The `App.scss` file will include all PatternFly Sass along with
PatternFly React Sass extensions. Once Sass compiles, the resulting CSS can be found in `src/css/App.css`.

Note:
Only static assets which are `import` 'ed into your application will be included in your resulting build output.

== Testing
To run the tests:
[source,shell]
----
npm test
----

Note: for OS/X users testing requires watchman to be installed
[source,shell]
----
brew install watchman
----

== For Storybook Components
[source,shell]
----
npm run storybook
http://localhost:6006
----

== General

This project was bootstrapped with https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app[create-react-app]
