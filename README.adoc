= Kiali UI

== Introduction

A UI for the Kiali Istio Observability Project

== Technologies
* React.js
* Redux

== Quick Start
[source,shell]
----
npm install -g yarn
yarn
yarn start
----

[NOTE]
On some platforms, `yarn start` may fail with an error like `Error: ENOSPC: System limit for number of file watchers reached`. To fix this, you need to increase the limit of file watchers on your system. The command may vary depending on the platform, please refer to link:https://github.com/guard/listen/wiki/Increasing-the-amount-of-inotify-watchers[these instructions].

A new browser window should automatically open.
But, if it doesn't then use:
`http://localhost:3000`

This launches a development environment that instantly
reloads any changes to the browser for rapid development.

== Directory Structure
* `build`: Production build output
* `public`: Home of index.html
* `src`: Source and test code
* `src/actions`:  Redux actions
* `src/app`: React top level component
* `src/assets`: Images and other assets
* `src/config`: Configuration
* `src/containers`: [.line-through]#Redux connected containers# _Deprecated_
* `src/components`: React Components
* `src/fonts`:  Fonts
* `src/images`:  Patternfly Images
* `src/pages`: Top level pages and nested components
* `src/reducers`: Redux reducers
* `src/services`: Api services
* `src/store`:  Redux store definitions
* `src/types`: Typescript definitions for all kinds of types
* `src/utils`: Various Utilities

== Developing

We use `yarn` as the package manager, if adding dependencies to `package.json`
make sure you install them with `yarn` and commit the `yarn.lock` file.

=== Testing with Kiali

When developing, it is usual to run this application outside of https://github.com/kiali/kiali[kiali].

It is possible to proxy the API requests without having to push the changes to kiali.
Add the https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#proxying-api-requests-in-development[proxy]
property to `package.json` with the url of kiali.

If Kiali is configured with a specific web root, make sure to append it to the URL. On many setups with Kubernetes, the web root will be `/kiali` by default.

Run `yarn start` and try it!
[source, bash]

$ curl -u admin:admin http://localhost:3000/api

Type: ClusterIP

=== Styling
https://www.patternfly.org/[PatternFly] is the main UI components framework. It defines style based on SASS preprocessor.
All Patternfly build assets are copied to `src`.
Any React component may have its related SCSS file (such as `App.scss` - this one includes all PatternFly Sass along with
PatternFly React Sass extensions).
Once Sass compiles, the resulting CSS can be found next to its SCSS counterpart (ex: `src/app/App.css`).

To compile CSS, run:
[source,shell]
----
yarn build-css
----

Note:
Only static assets which are `import` 'ed into your application will be included in your resulting build output.

=== RCUE Styling
To use the https://redhat-rcue.github.io/[RCUE] styled css instead of normal Patternfly

For development run:
[source,shell]
----
env REACT_APP_RCUE=true yarn start
----

For production build run:
[source,shell]
----
env REACT_APP_RCUE=true yarn build
----

=== Style Code Guide

See the link:./STYLE_GUIDE.adoc[STYLE CODE GUIDE file].

=== Testing
To run the tests, the standard command `yarn test` is valid,
but since some tests are using link:https://facebook.github.io/jest/docs/en/snapshot-testing.html[snapshots] the preferred command is to update them in the same time:
[source,shell]
----
yarn test -u
----

Then hit `a` to run all tests.

After running the tests, if any snapshot has been modified (check git status),
the diff should be reviewed to make sure it's an intentional or trivial change.
Modified snapshots must be part of the commit so that they're reviewed collectively and won't make CI build fail.

Note: for OS/X users testing requires watchman to be installed
[source,shell]
----
brew install watchman
----

== Testing Libraries for Vulnerabilities
We use https://snyk.io/[Snyk] for JS vulnerability testing. Snyke will run automatically on every commit pushed to `kiali-ui`.

If you wish to run Snyk manually to test before you push, then the following command can be used:
[source,shell]
----
yarn run snyk
----


== Production Builds
Use `yarn build` which will bundle the build artifacts using webpack into the `build` directory.

== Analyze Javascript Library Size
To produce a graphical representation of the all the libraries in the project (showing what % of total each one is).
[source,shell]
----
yarn build
yarn run analyze
----
Which will then launch a browser with your graphical source map displayed.
